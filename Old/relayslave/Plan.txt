Plan:

Relay slave has three outputs connected to ULN2003 driving relays controlling AC. 

In response to RF command, provide the following behavior for each relay:
*Turn on or off
*Turn on, and then turn off after a delay
*Turn off, and then turn back on after a delay
*Wait, and then turn on after a delay
*Wait, and then turn off after a delay
*Wait, and then turn on for specified period of time, then turn back off.
*Wait, and then turn off for specified period of time, then turn back on.

In response to RF command, provide the following behavior for a short attached WS2812 LED strip:
*Set pixels, with and without immediate latch (as already implemented)
*Load presets

In response to RF command
* Set default power on state for relays
* Set max time on for each relay
